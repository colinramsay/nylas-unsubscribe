## Unsubscribe Button

An unsubscribe button for the Nylus N1 mail client. **Work in progress**.

Where available, the plugin will detect either list-unsubscriber email headers or an HTML unsubscribe link. When one of these is found plugin will offer the user a button on an email message to quickly unsubscribe from the newletter/autoresponder.

### Still to do

Well, it doesn't really work yet but the fundamentals are there :) Basically:

- [x] Auto-unsubscribe logic
- [ ] UI feedback of unsubscribe
